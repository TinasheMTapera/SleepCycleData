# Sleep Cycle Data Analysis

How well do we sleep? In today's world, we have access to technologies that can help us examine our own sleep with the push of a button. [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com/) is one such technology that I began using for tracking my sleep long before I ever thought I would be a data scientist. 

I used it for a large enough amount of time that it ended up producing a sizable data set, that my growing data science skills simply had to take advantage of! In this repository, you can view or download the Rmarkdown file that documents my analysis, wherein I practiced some cleaning of text data, functional programming, and multinomial classification and interpretation.

Additionally, the PDF of the slides I presented on the project are also available.
